<!-- CRACKERJACK INTEGRATION START -->

This project uses crackerjack for Python project management and quality assurance.

For optimal development experience with this crackerjack - enabled project, use these specialized agents:

- **🏗️ crackerjack-architect**: Expert in crackerjack's modular architecture and Python project management patterns. **Use PROACTIVELY** for all feature development, architectural decisions, and ensuring code follows crackerjack standards from the start.

- **🐍 python-pro**: Modern Python development with type hints, async/await patterns, and clean architecture

- **🧪 pytest-hypothesis-specialist**: Advanced testing patterns, property-based testing, and test optimization

- **🧪 crackerjack-test-specialist**: Advanced testing specialist for complex testing scenarios and coverage optimization

- **🏗️ backend-architect**: System design, API architecture, and service integration patterns

- **🔒 security-auditor**: Security analysis, vulnerability detection, and secure coding practices

```bash

Task tool with subagent_type ="crackerjack-architect" for feature planning


Task tool with subagent_type ="python-pro" for code implementation


Task tool with subagent_type ="pytest-hypothesis-specialist" for test development


Task tool with subagent_type ="security-auditor" for security analysis
```

**💡 Pro Tip**: The crackerjack-architect agent automatically ensures code follows crackerjack patterns from the start, eliminating the need for retrofitting and quality fixes.

This project follows crackerjack's clean code philosophy:

- **EVERY LINE OF CODE IS A LIABILITY**: The best code is no code

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: If you write it twice, you're doing it wrong

- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Build only what's needed NOW

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Complexity is the enemy of maintainability

- \*\*Cognitive complexity ≤15 \*\*per function (automatically enforced)

- **Coverage ratchet system**: Never decrease coverage, always improve toward 100%

- **Type annotations required**: All functions must have return type hints

- **Security patterns**: No hardcoded paths, proper temp file handling

- **Python 3.13+ modern patterns**: Use `|` unions, pathlib over os.path

```bash

python -m crackerjack


python -m crackerjack - t


python -m crackerjack - - ai - agent - t


python -m crackerjack - a patch
```

1. **Plan with crackerjack-architect**: Ensure proper architecture from the start
1. **Implement with python-pro**: Follow modern Python patterns
1. **Test comprehensively**: Use pytest-hypothesis-specialist for robust testing
1. **Run quality checks**: `python -m crackerjack -t` before committing
1. **Security review**: Use security-auditor for final validation

- **Use crackerjack-architect agent proactively** for all significant code changes
- **Never reduce test coverage** - the ratchet system only allows improvements
- **Follow crackerjack patterns** - the tools will enforce quality automatically
- **Leverage AI agent auto-fixing** - `python -m crackerjack --ai-agent -t` for autonomous quality fixes
